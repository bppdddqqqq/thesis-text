# Trezor
Is a brand of hardware-based cryptowallets made by [SatoshiLabs](https://satoshilabs.com/). During their time, they released two products [[Trezor Model T]]# and [[Trezor One]]#. Trezor One is their first product with proud proclamation of being the first hardware-based cryptowallet on the market (citation needed). Nowadays it serves as a lower-end product with Trezor Model T replacing it as their flagship device, with upgraded features and hardware.

Trezor also maintains a firmware called [[Trezor Core]] and a cryptographical suite called [[Trezor Crypto]]

Aside from that they also develop a software wallet called [[Trezor Suite]], which also serves as a companion app to their devices. The software allows user to update their devices, manage associated wallets and backups. There is also a more lightweight software offered called Trezor Wallet, feature-wise it is similar to Suite, but it has wider support of cryptocurrencies.

## Usability info
Their primary source of guidance and information is [their wiki](https://wiki.trezor.io/) and social media/support listed out here:
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trezor)
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/trezor.io)
- [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/trezor)
- [Support Center](https://trezor.io/support)
- [Forum](https://forum.trezor.io/)

One thing that stands out from other manufacturers is that they don't prefer to use classical manuals and instead opt for video guides and wiki.
