# Infineon SLE78 (family)
It is a family of SE SOCs, due to the nature of the research, I've privied to find the specific models and populate the specs here. But due to the fact that it is a family of SOCs I won't populate it further without prior consultation.

The family of SOCs is popular for it's high level evaluation assurance level (EAL6+) and versatility in the cryptographical space. They have 2 different flavours, one meant for ID cards, the other for NFC cards and various storage and feature-set combinations.
