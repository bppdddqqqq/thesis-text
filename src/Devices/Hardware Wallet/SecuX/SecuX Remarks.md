there is an FCC filing here [SecuX Technology . V20 Crypto Hardware Wallet, W20 Crypto Hardware Wallet SX001 FCC ID 2ASNW-SX001](https://fccid.io/2ASNW-SX001)
but its only for W20, but where is V20 and V10? As for V20, it uses bluetooh, FCC filing is mandatory. Ok the filing seems to entail all of the devices as a product range. Likely possibility that hardware is only upgraded incrementally and communication chips are not subject of change between models.

The SE is possibly [InfoKeyVault S97 Omni](https://www.ikv-tech.com/index.php/en-us/platforms/s97-omni), probably Infineon clone of the already popular SLE 97 range of SEs, already covered here. **already communicating with the vendors to pull more details**, the specsheet doesn't yield any information about the hardware chip and is covered in utter secrecy.
