It's recommended to refer to [[Ledger Nano S]] for categories which are not included here.

## At a glance

### Transparency

The device shares the same code base as [[Ledger Nano S]]. Running on BOLOS and using shared ecosystem of "apps" as it's predeccessor.

Most major change is in the hardware, the screen and buttons are no longer operated by the MCU which is highly susceptible to attacks as it was done on the S but by the Secure Element. With MCU only handling storage of appsand USB communication between host device and secure element.

Another change is upgrade of the MCU that allows the X to store more apps, according to the vendor "up to 100". This allows the user for greater flexibility in using multiple cryptos without the need to reinstall apps if the user needs to do something.
