# Blockstream Green
It is a cross-platform software client for managing Bitcoin and Liquid Network assets. The software has clients for both the computers (Windows, Mac, Linux) and phones (iOS, Android). The client boasts with support for Blockstream's [[Liquid Network]] and a technology called Multisig Shield.
The software supports multiple hardware wallets such as their-own Jade, Ledger and Trezor albeit the support for Liquid Network is only officially supported on Jade with limited support for Ledger (verify, only inferred from KB).
Multisig Shield in summary is a 2-on-3 wallet where 2 parts of the keys are held by the user and the third key is backed up to Blockstream's cloud with restricted access via 2FA. This feature is optional and user can opt for single key wallet instead.
Software also manages software updates for [[Blockstream Jade (deprecated)]].
