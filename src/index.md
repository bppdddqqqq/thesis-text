## Devices

Each device has a page that pulls information from various sources. Currently, there are two standards of writing the document, old Devices and new DevicesV2 spec, which aims to cover most of the insufficiencies of the former documentation format. In addition, the format also entails more standardized approaches of evaluating the devices.

## Interesting things to probably look onto

https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/hardware/ledgernanos/?platform=hardware&step=5 <- establish as baseline for wiki entries?
https://thecharlatan.ch/List-Of-Hardware-Wallet-Hacks/ <- this is a very good list of all security incidents
https://www.creditbit.org/ <- comparision of hardware wallets (:
https://github.com/INTERPOL-Innovation-Centre/HardwareWallets_DF_List <- digital forensics

## Software wallets/clients
Software wallets which also double as clients for devices made by manufacturers. More or less an essential thing to have/own.
