```In 2020, we evaluated the Microchip ATECC508A Secure Memory circuit. We identiﬁed a vulnerability allowing an attacker to read a secret data slot using single Laser Fault Injection. Subsequently, the product life cycle of this chip turned to be deprecated, and the circuit has been superseded by the ATECC608A, supposedly more secure. We present a new attack allowing retrieval of the same data slot secret for this new chip, using a double Laser Fault Injection to bypass two security tests during a single command execution. A particular hardware wallet is vulnerable to this attack, as it allows stealing the secret seed protected by the Secure Element. This work was conducted in a black box approach. We explain the attack path identiﬁcation process, using help from power trace analysis and up to 4 faults in a single command, during an intermediate testing campaign. We construct a ﬁrmware implementation hypothesis based on our results to explain how the security and one double-check counter-measure are bypassed.```

The attack primarily affects [[BitBox02]] and [[Foundation Passport]] and is related to usage of [[Microchip ATECC608A SE]] as an SE.
